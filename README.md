*Strong lightâ€“matter coupling in two-dimensional atomic crystals.*

This project has been realised in the context of the Quantum electronics course from Keio University (Japan). Sep 2019 - Jan 2020.

Strong interaction between light and matter is the phenomenon under which the interaction rate between the light and the matter is faster than the dissipation rate.
This effect can be enhanced by appropriate material and optical structures. The result of this interaction is the creation of a new particle called "polaritons" being a mix of light and matter. This breakthrough paves the way for new photonic device applications.

The goal was to understand various concepts of quantum electronics, analysis of material and results as well as the possible applications.
Method of analysis was based on the physical and mathematical tools developed in the course.

Finally, the design of possible applications was asked.
